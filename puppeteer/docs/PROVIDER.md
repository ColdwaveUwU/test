# Provider Addon

The **Provider Addon** is an abstract class designed to facilitate testing across various platforms such as WOPI, OwnCloud, and others. It provides a framework for interacting with different file providers during automated tests.

## Supported provider addons

-   [**Wopi**](../providers/wopi/)
-   [**DocSpace**](../providers/docspace)
-   [**OwnCloud**](../providers/owncloud/)

## Provider Config

The provider configuration defines the settings needed to connect and interact with a specific provider, such as WOPI or OwnCloud. This configuration is typically specified in a `config.json` file and can include options for testing, reporting, and more.

### Example: WOPI Config

```json
{
    "testOptions": {
        "url": "https://isa2.teamlab.info/example"
    },
    "reportOptions": {
        "ignoreBrowserErrors": ["Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()"]
    }
}
```

## Example of Using Provider Addon

To use the **Provider Addon**, you need to specify a provider configuration that contains the necessary settings for connecting to and interacting with your desired platform (e.g., WOPI, OwnCloud).
Here is an example of a main configuration with a specified provider (config_chrome_win.json):

```json
{
    "testOptions": {
        "url": "https://kim.teamlab.info/example",
        "urlParam": "action={\"debug\":true}",
        "debugMode": true,
        "messageType": ["error", "log"],
        "cacheEnabled": true
    },
    "puppeteerOptions": {
        "browser": "chrome",
        "headless": false,
        "puppeteerDelay": 0,
        "userDelay": 0,
        "executablePath": "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe"
    },
    "reportOptions": {
        "ignoreBrowserErrors": ["Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()"],
        "ignoreExternalScriptsErrors": ["Checking file for encryption is not supported on Windows"]
    },
    "provider": "wopi.json"
}
```

### Explanation:

-   **`provider`**: This key specifies the path or name of the addon (e.g., `wopiAddon.js`) that will be used to handle interactions with the provider platform.

## Executing Tests with Provider Addon

When executing tests, the **Provider Addon** mechanism loads the provider-specific configuration and merges it with the main configuration. The merged configuration is then used to instantiate the tester class, which runs the tests according to the specified options.

Hereâ€™s how to execute the tests with the **Provider Addon**:

1. **Prepare the Configuration**: Ensure you have a main configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) and, if applicable, a provider-specific configuration file within the provider's directory.

2. **Specify the Provider**: In your main configuration, include the `"provider"` key with the path to the desired addon. The addon should include any provider-specific settings that need to override the main configuration.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the test script, which will read the configuration file, load the provider addon, and merge the configurations.

### Example Command to Execute a Test

```bash
python run.py example/download_example.js
```

### Merging Behavior:

-   If the main config and the provider config have the same keys, the provider config values will override the main config values.
-   This allows specific settings to be adjusted based on the provider while keeping general settings consistent.
